                <p>I am a seasoned e-commerce specialist, PM Director, graphic designer and web-developer professional.</p>
                <p>I carry over 10 years of professional experience working for both governmental and private establishments. I started my career during the civil service where I was staffed as an administrative assistant, and soon enough worked my way towards the office manager position, where I was in full charge of the operation of a 400+ employee department. Once discharged, I moved on to the private sector, and successfully filled the role of a paralegal assistant for several years.</p>
                <p>For the past few years I expressed growing interest in web technologies, and that led me to the role of a project manager for a busy web development company specializing in e-commerce (Magento-centered) in Denver, CO from which I kept evolving forward into other interesting roles in the industry including being an information source, technical artical writer, trainer, and producer of training materials.</p> 
                <p>My past management experience in high-paced environments along with quick adaptation of web development processes allowed me to coordinate all stages of the dev work, from design through development and programming, thorugh the very launch, using dedicated PM and Agile tools, and following a strict schedule. Aside from management roles, I’m also a graphic designer and artist, who specializes in apparel (socks, shirts, hats, etc.), print (catalogs, business cards, menus, etc.), branding, photo-shopping and web design.</p> 
                <p>Don’t hesitate to contact me!</p>
